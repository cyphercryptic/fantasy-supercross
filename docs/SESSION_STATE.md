# Session State — pick up here next time

**Last updated:** 2026-05-30

## Status: MX 2026 season underway — Round 1 (Fox Raceway) is TODAY

Draft is complete, rosters saved, lineups locking at gate drop. The app is fully MX-aware end to end (draft, lineup, schedule, settings, stats, status). Everything below is live in production (`fantasy-supercross.vercel.app`, auto-deploys from `main`).

## MX scoring model (changed 2026-05-30)

- **Each moto scored individually and summed per rider** (not the combined overall). A 1-1 = 20 pts/class. Points table (per moto): `1→10, 2→8, 3→7, 4→6, 5→5, 6-7→4, 8-10→3, 11-14→2, 15-20→1, 21+→0` (`getMxMotoPoints`). **SX is unchanged** (`getPointsForPosition`, pays 21-22 = 1).
- **No moto-winner bonus.** **Holeshot = +1 per moto** (so up to 2/class/event).
- Stored `race_results.position` = rider's running **average finish** across their motos (drives the avg-finish stat).
- **Incremental import:** the cron scores whatever motos are posted and recomputes each run (idempotent). MX races stay `status='upcoming'` (so scoring keeps refreshing) until the **overall** posts, then flip to `completed`.
- **Live refresh:** `POST /api/cron/auto-import` (session-authed, delegates to the nightly GET) + a **"Refresh results"** button on the league Standings card — pull results live as motos finish. Note the nightly cron only runs once at 06:00 UTC, so use the button (or a future frequent cron) to watch live. Import only acts once `race_time` (gate drop) has passed.
- Parsing risk: moto classification (`classifyRace`) depends on promotocross race names ("450 Class Moto 1" etc.) — unverified against live data; watch the first import.

## Open items

1. **tsfranklin (user 6) lineup for Round 1** — as of last check user 4 had set 16, user 6 had **0**. He must set 8×450 + 8×250 before gate drop (Fox Raceway locks **2026-05-30 20:00 UTC = 1 PM PT**).
2. **Verify the first MX results import** — the auto-import cron runs nightly at **06:00 UTC (~11 PM PT)**. Round 1 is the first-ever live MX import; the `results.promotocross.com` domain + URL structure were confirmed correct and **Fox Raceway = event_id 506003**. After the cron fires (Sun ~06:00 UTC), confirm Round 1 scored (race_results + race_bonuses populated, race status flipped to `completed`, leaderboard shows points). Fix parsing if needed. *(Optionally pre-set `event_id='506003'` on round 1 to skip auto-discovery — SQL was provided, confirm if run.)*
3. **MX injury status is manual** — the injury cron (`/api/cron/injury-report`) is SX-only. Set `rider_series.status='out'` manually when MX riders get hurt. Note: `riders.status` holds stale SX injuries (24 riders incl. Jett Lawrence) — MX UI now reads `rider_series.status` everywhere, so ignore `riders.status` for MX.
4. **Latent (display-only):** `team/page.tsx:1096` and `free-agents/page.tsx:459` still append `"Z"` to `created_at` for transaction dates — may show "Invalid Date". Not fixed.

## What was done 2026-05-30 (this session)

All committed/pushed to `main` and live:
- **Full rider pool** — 146 riders (71×450MX, 75×250MX) from the official Fox Raceway entry list; bikes backfilled (drives team color). All `active` in `rider_series`.
- **Roster size → 20** (was 22), kept 8×450 / 8×250. League settings card made series-aware (single "250 Slots" for MX, not East/West).
- **Draft fixes:** `league_rosters` unique constraint (draft now saves rosters), auto-pick draws from series pool, dead timer fixed (`+00:00` parsing), draft-page resilience (ignores non-200, login screen on 401, self-recovers), Recent Picks + Coming Up ticker tinted with each team's bike-brand color.
- **Schedule fixed:** `races` id sequence was behind `max(id)`, so the original MX seed silently dropped 10 of 11 rounds (only R4 survived); resynced sequence + restored all 11. Made `/schedule` series-aware (SX/MX toggle, no bogus "250 WEST" on MX).
- **Race times set** — all 11 rounds have `race_time` = first-moto gate drop (1 PM local per promotocross TV schedule). Lineups lock at gate drop. Round 2 renamed to official "Hangtown Motocross Classic".
- **Lineup (team page) made MX-aware** — race picker scoped to series + auto-selects next race; team API returns `series`, scopes upcoming race, and remaps roster/lineup **class + status** from `rider_series` (riders.class/status are stale SX). 450MX/250MX groups, no East/West.
- **Stats scoped to series** — rider-stats only counts the league's series races (no more SX-season points on MX teams).
- **Lineup lock fix** — `isRaceLocked` no longer locks at midnight of race day when `race_time` is unset (now that all races have race_time this is moot, but it's the correct fallback).

## MX league (DB)

- League ID: **3**, `series='mx'`, `draft_status='completed'`, `roster_size=20`
- `lineup_450=8` (450MX starters/wk), `lineup_250e=8` (250MX starters — column repurposed), `lineup_250w=0` (unused)
- Members: user **4** = connorfranklin499 (commissioner, Connor), user **6** = tsfranklin (Connor's dad, real user)
- 40 roster rows (20 per user)
