# Session State — pick up here next time

**Last updated:** 2026-06-03

## Status: MX 2026 season underway — Round 1 (Fox Raceway) is TODAY

Draft is complete, rosters saved, lineups locking at gate drop. The app is fully MX-aware end to end (draft, lineup, schedule, settings, stats, status). Everything below is live in production (`fantasy-supercross.vercel.app`, auto-deploys from `main`).

## MX scoring model (changed 2026-05-30)

- **Each moto scored individually and summed per rider** (not the combined overall). A 1-1 = 20 pts/class. Points table (per moto): `1→10, 2→8, 3→7, 4→6, 5→5, 6-7→4, 8-10→3, 11-14→2, 15-20→1, 21+→0` (`getMxMotoPoints`). **SX is unchanged** (`getPointsForPosition`, pays 21-22 = 1).
- **No moto-winner bonus.** **Holeshot = +1 per moto** (so up to 2/class/event).
- Stored `race_results.position` = rider's running **average finish** across their motos (drives the avg-finish stat).
- **Incremental import:** the cron scores whatever motos are posted and recomputes each run (idempotent). MX races stay `status='upcoming'` (so scoring keeps refreshing) until the **overall** posts, then flip to `completed`.
- **Live refresh:** `POST /api/cron/auto-import` (session-authed, delegates to the nightly GET) + a **"Refresh results"** button on the league Standings card — pull results live as motos finish. Note the nightly cron only runs once at 06:00 UTC, so use the button (or a future frequent cron) to watch live. Import only acts once `race_time` (gate drop) has passed.
- **Import verified live (Round 1, 2026-05-30):** 250 Moto 1 scored correctly. Two bugs fixed along the way: event-id city matching (exact substrings → shared-word `cityMatchesRace`, fixes verify + auto-discover) and moto parsing (`classifyRace` now allows "Moto **#**1"). Fox Raceway `event_id=506003` set. Promotocross moto links are named "250 Class Moto #1".

## Round 1 audit + duplicate-rider fix (2026-06-03)

Audited every Round 1 moto score against the official source (results.promotocross.com event 506003, all 4 motos parsed from raw HTML). **All 83 result values + 4 holeshots imported correctly** — positions, summed moto points, avg finish all matched. The only defect was a **duplicate-rider** problem, not a scoring bug:

- The 2026-05-29 full-entry-list seed created **second `riders` rows** for 4 people who already existed from SX (Hampshire, Romano, Noren, Luhovey). The importer's `findRider` matches by **name across the whole `riders` table**, so promotocross's SX-style spelling ("Nicholas Romano", "R.J. Hampshire", "Freddie Noren", "Vinny Luhovey") matched the **original SX rows** — while the MX draft/rosters/lineups pointed at the **new duplicate** rows. Result: a rostered rider's correct points landed on a record the lineup didn't reference.
- **RJ Hampshire** (started by tsfranklin/KTM Dad) was the only rostered casualty → his 8 pts didn't count.
- **Fix applied (SQL, 2026-06-03):** merged each MX-dup back into its original/canonical id (Hampshire 150→126, Romano 198→140, Noren 154→16, Luhovey 178→68 — moved `rider_series` mx + roster/lineup/draft_pick, deleted the dup `riders` rows). Kept the **official timing-site spelling** as the canonical name so future imports exact-match with **no aliases** needed. Also added **Vince Friese** (#719) to the MX pool (`rider_series` row on existing id 33; raced R1 450, not rostered) and fixed **Jett Lawrence's** MX number **18→1** (#1 plate). No `race_results` edits were needed.
- **Corrected Round 1 final: Elbows Out 129, KTM Dad 102** (was 94). Verified in DB.
- **Watch for recurrence:** any rider with a duplicate `riders` row + name that differs from promotocross is the failure mode. All numbers verified accurate as of R1 (Webb #2, Deegan #38 already correct).

## Open items

1. **Round 1 (Fox Raceway) is scored, complete & audited.** Final: **Elbows Out 129, KTM Dad 102**. Round 2 = Hangtown (Jun 6) — watch that it auto-discovers (event name "Hangtown Motocross Classic" vs venue "Prairie City"; `cityMatchesRace` should handle it, but verify race day).
2. **MX injury status is manual** — the injury cron (`/api/cron/injury-report`) is SX-only. Set `rider_series.status='out'` manually when MX riders get hurt. `riders.status` holds stale SX injuries (24 riders incl. Jett Lawrence) — MX UI reads `rider_series.status` everywhere, so ignore `riders.status` for MX.
3. **Remaining low-priority SX-isms** (audited 2026-05-30, NOT fixed — non-user-facing): standalone `/lineup` and `/roster` pages still use SX class logic but **nothing links to them**; the **Admin → Riders** class dropdown is 450/250E/250W (only matters if manually adding MX riders there).

### Fixed in the 2026-05-30 MX-awareness audit
Standings breakdown, weekly recap, season recap all now override class from `rider_series` and scope races to the league's series (recap previously defaulted to the SX finale and mis-bucketed 450MX riders into 250 / mistook 4 moto holeshots for a Triple Crown). Transaction-date "Invalid Date" (`+ "Z"`) fixed on team + free-agents. Renew/"Start New Season" button now gated on `seasonOver` (all races completed), not just draft-complete.

## What was done 2026-05-30 (this session)

All committed/pushed to `main` and live:
- **Full rider pool** — 146 riders (71×450MX, 75×250MX) from the official Fox Raceway entry list; bikes backfilled (drives team color). All `active` in `rider_series`.
- **Roster size → 20** (was 22), kept 8×450 / 8×250. League settings card made series-aware (single "250 Slots" for MX, not East/West).
- **Draft fixes:** `league_rosters` unique constraint (draft now saves rosters), auto-pick draws from series pool, dead timer fixed (`+00:00` parsing), draft-page resilience (ignores non-200, login screen on 401, self-recovers), Recent Picks + Coming Up ticker tinted with each team's bike-brand color.
- **Schedule fixed:** `races` id sequence was behind `max(id)`, so the original MX seed silently dropped 10 of 11 rounds (only R4 survived); resynced sequence + restored all 11. Made `/schedule` series-aware (SX/MX toggle, no bogus "250 WEST" on MX).
- **Race times set** — all 11 rounds have `race_time` = first-moto gate drop (1 PM local per promotocross TV schedule). Lineups lock at gate drop. Round 2 renamed to official "Hangtown Motocross Classic".
- **Lineup (team page) made MX-aware** — race picker scoped to series + auto-selects next race; team API returns `series`, scopes upcoming race, and remaps roster/lineup **class + status** from `rider_series` (riders.class/status are stale SX). 450MX/250MX groups, no East/West.
- **Stats scoped to series** — rider-stats only counts the league's series races (no more SX-season points on MX teams).
- **Lineup lock fix** — `isRaceLocked` no longer locks at midnight of race day when `race_time` is unset (now that all races have race_time this is moot, but it's the correct fallback).

## MX league (DB)

- League ID: **3**, `series='mx'`, `draft_status='completed'`, `roster_size=20`
- `lineup_450=8` (450MX starters/wk), `lineup_250e=8` (250MX starters — column repurposed), `lineup_250w=0` (unused)
- Members: user **4** = connorfranklin499 (commissioner, Connor), user **6** = tsfranklin (Connor's dad, real user)
- 40 roster rows (20 per user)
